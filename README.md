You'll want to understand how layers work. They're simple.

In this template there are 4 layers,
* A layer with guide lines to align to
* A layer for the header and footer
* A layer for the boxes that contain your content
* A layer for your content

Most of the time you'll probably want to hide the guide line layer, and lock all the layers except the one for your content
